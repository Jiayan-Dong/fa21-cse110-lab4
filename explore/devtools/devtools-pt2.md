## DevTools - Debugging

1. What was the bug? `document.getElementById("num1").value` and `document.getElementById("num2").value` both return string value, so variable `num1` and `num2` are defined as `"string"`. When `num1` and `num2` are passed in function `calculateSum`, `let result = num1 + num2` interprets `+` as string concatenation, so function `calculateSum` returns a string concatenation of `num1` and `num2`. But we actually want the sum of `num1` and `num2` with type of `"number"`, so this causes a bug.
2. How would you fix it? When we define `num1` and `num2`, we convert them to type `"number"` by function `Number()`. So, we have `let num1 = Number(document.getElementById("num1").value);` and `let num2 = Number(document.getElementById("num2").value);`. Since `num1` and `num2` now have type of `"number"`, in function `calculateSum`, `let result = num1 + num2` interprets `+` as arithmetic operation. So, function `calculateSum` returns a sum of `num1` and `num2`, which fixes this bug.
